# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project was to assist our client, Robin, in her exploration of data on Mars. Specifically, our client would like to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images of Mars. To do this, we have used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.

While images are not currently loading, for the hemispheres, the goal is to continue to learn how html and bootstrapping can facilitate the presentation of research data.
